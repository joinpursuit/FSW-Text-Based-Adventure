Riad comes from the Arabic word for ‘garden’ and as such, a traditional riad is built around a courtyard or a garden. The gardens are usually very manicured and often include fountains. Some riads, particularly the luxury riads, also have on-site swimming pools and even private hammams for their guests. Another interesting and unique aspect of a riad compared to a traditional hotel is that there are no exterior windows. The windows in a riad all look inwards towards the garden or the courtyard. This reflects the importance of privacy in the Islamic culture, but also has the added benefit of keeping the air cool, which is a huge perk given the heat of Morocco’s temperatures. \n");
